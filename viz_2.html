          <b>Caption:</b> This is a stacked bar chart that show the average time
          it takes for the SF Fire Department to react to calls in different zip
          codes. This is broken up into stages and colored using the color theme
          of this site. The time series is linked to the stacked bar chart. The
          time series charts total average time up to on scene by call date in an
          area chart. This supports brushing so you can select the date range
          you want in the area chart and this will be reflected in the
          the stacked bar chart. NOTE that the axes will change based on
          the selection. It is sorted by highest average time to scene per zip
          code. The data is from 2015 onward. To see more about the
          <a href="https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Fire-Department-Calls-for-Service/nuek-vuh3">data</a>
          see <a href="data.html">here</a>.
        </p>

        <div id="flow" style="width: 600px">
          <img src="assets/time_types.svg" alt="Time types of call" width="600px;">
        </div>

        <p>
          An important thing to note for understanding this visualization is how
          the times are broken up. The diagram shows the general flow of steps
          that are involved in a call for service. This visualization focuses on
          the received time up to the on scence time. The choice was made due to
          curiosity about how long a call for service may take for help to
          arrive in different areas. Since not all records included all times,
          this visualization opts to remove those records entirely to be more
          clear. This visualization only shows calls that resulted in the Fire
          Department arriving at the scene. Hover and wait over a box for more
          details about the call type. View the
          <a href="data.html">data page</a> for additonal details about the data.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another thing to note is that the length of the entire stacked bar
          represents the average time it took to arrive on scene for a given
          zipcode in the given time frame. This may raise questions about
          improperly calculated averages since the sum of partial averages is
          not the same as the total average. However, since all null records
          have been dropped, the count for each segment of the bar is the same
          for each stacked bar. The count is displayed in the tooltip for each
          bar segment. Visit
          <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/95909/why-is-an-average-of-an-average-usually-incorrect">StackExchange</a>
          for more details about why averages of averages are usually inaccurate.
        </p>

        <h3 id="encoding">Data Encoding</h3>
        <p>
          The data has already been filtered for 2015 and onward. For more
          details about how the data is filtered, see the
          <a href="data.html">data page</a>. Note that these visualizations
          <b>do not</b> remove outliers. However, we can use this visualization
          to identify where the outliers come from.
        </p>

        <p>
          The stacked bar chart is encoded by average time to arrive on scene
          and zipcode. It is sorted by the highest number of minutes to arrive
          on scene. The area chart is encoded by call date and average minutes
          to arrive on scene. All null and empty records have been removed.
        </p>

        <h3 id="instructions">Instructions</h3>
        <p>
          The colors of the bars are more vibrant to pull it to the foreground.
          In order to emphasize the bars more, hovering over the bars will lower
          opacity of the other categories. This also allows easier comparison
          between different bar lengths of the same category. This can also be
          done by hovering over the legend labels.
        </p>

        <p>
          To see details about each bar, hover over the bar for a tooltip.
          Further explanation of the tooltips are defined below:
        </p>

              </td>
              <td>
                The type of the bar segment that is being hovered over. This is
                the same as the labels in the legend.

            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>
                Average
              </td>
              <td>
                This is the length of the bar segment in minutes. This would be
                the average minutes from the end of one stage to the next stage.
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>

              </td>
              <td>
                This is the length of the entire stacked bar in minutes. This
                represents the average minutes it took for the fire department
                to arrive on scene for the given zipcode.
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>
                Total Count
              </td>
              <td>
                This is the total number of calls being represented in the given
                bar chart.
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>
                Zipcode
              </td>
              <td>
                This is the zipcode the bar represents. Hover over for the
                neighborhood mapping.
              </td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>
          Tooltips were also added to the zip codes to show which neighborhood
          it corresponds to. Note that each zip code maps to multiple
          neighborhoods. To remain consistent with what the Fire Department
          uses, the neighborhood mapping was drawn from the how the data was
          labeled in the dataset. If the zipcode was improperly labeled, the
          tooltip will also show the same inconsistencies. However, this seemed
          to be the most accurate way to represent the information.
        </p>

        <p>
          To encourage data exploration, brushing on the x axis for the area
          chart is supported. This will filter the stacked bar chart based on
          the time range of the brush. Click and drag in the area chart to
          create a range and click out of the range in the area chart to reset.
          You can adjust the brushed selection by moving it or by adjusting the
          size. Since it is a little difficult to see what date range you have
          selected, the date range is displayed (and is updated) above the
          stacked bar chart.
        </p>

        <h3 id="analysis">Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          From this visualization we can learn several things:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            It seems that 94129 and 94130 show up near the top in many date
            ranges. This makes sense since it is the Presidio and Treasure
            Island, respectively. This may mean that the Fire Department might
            need an additional station in either of those places. Although it
            should be noted that the visualization does <b>not</b> account for
            density of calls. Luckily, other
            <a href="viz_3.html">visualizations</a> on this site show the
            density.
          </li>
          <li>
            The time from response to arrival always seems to take the most
            time, so any attempt at alleviating traffic for the Fire Department
            would help immensely. Additional or closer stations may also
            expedite arrivals.
          </li>
          <li>
            We can also see dramatic spikes in the area chart which implies that
            there are outliers or events that took substantially longer than
            expected. Using brushing, we can confirm this is the case and narrow
            the date range of the incidences. For example, 94111 had a very high
            entry time in the time frame of December 24th 2016 to December 27th,
            2016.
          </li>
        </ul>
