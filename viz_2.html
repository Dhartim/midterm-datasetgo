          <b>Caption:</b> This is a stacked bar chart that show the average time
          it takes for the SF Fire Department to react to calls in different zip
          codes. This is broken up into stages and colored using the color theme
          of this site. The time series is linked to the stacked bar chart. The
          time series charts total average time up to on scene by the time in an
          area chart. This supports brushing so you can select the data you want
          the stacked bar chart to show. NOTE that the axes will change based on
          the selection. Animating the bars resetting is an attempt at
          emphasizing that the data is different. It is sorted by highest
          average time to scene per zip code. The data is from 2015 onward. To
          see more about the
          <a href="https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Fire-Department-Calls-for-Service/nuek-vuh3">data</a>
          see <a href="data.html">here</a>.
        </p>

        <div id="flow" style="width: 600px">
          <img src="assets/time_types.svg" alt="Time types of call" width="600px;">
        </div>

        <p>
          An important thing to note for understanding this visualization is how
          the times are broken up. The diagram shows the general flow the steps
          involving a call for service. This visualization focuses on the times
          from received to on scene. The choice was merely made due to curiosity
          about how long a call for service may take for help to arrive. Not all
          entries include all times. This visualization opts to remove those
          records entirely to be more clear. This visualization only shows calls
          that resulted in the Fire Department arriving at the scene. Hover and
          wait over a box for more details about the call type. View the
          <a href="data.html">data page</a> for additonal details about the data.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another thing to note that the length of the entire stacked bar
          represents the average time it took to arrive on scene for a given
          zipcode in the given time frame. This may raise questions about
          improperly calculated averages since the sum of partial averages is
          not the same as the total average. However, since all null records
          have been dropped, the count for each segment of the bar is the same
          for each stacked bar. The count is displayed in the tooltip for each
          bar segment.
        </p>

        <h3 id="encoding">Data Encoding</h3>
        <p>
          The data has already been filtered for 2015 and onward. For more
          details about how the data is filtered, see the
          <a href="data.html">data page</a>. Note that these visualizations
          <b>do not</b> remove outliers. However, we can use this visualization
          to indentify where the outliers come from.
        </p>

        <p>
          The stacked bar chart is encoded by average time to arrive on scene
          and zipcode. It is sorted by the largest number of minutes to arrive
          on scene. The area chart is encoded by call date and average minutes
          to arrive on scene. All null and empty records have been removed.
        </p>

        <h3 id="instructions">Instructions</h3>
        <p>
          The colors of the bars are more vibrant to pull it to the foreground.
          In order to emphasize the bars more, hovering over the bars will lower
          opacity of the other categories. This also allows easier comparison
          between different bar lengths of the same category. This can also be
          done by hovering over the legend labels.
        </p>

        <p>
          To see details about each bar, hover over the bar for a tooltip. This
          tooltip includes Type, Average (the current bar segment),
          Total Average (the entire stacked bar), Total Count (calls represented
          in the stacked bar), and Zipcode (of the stacked bar).
        </p>

        <p>
          Tooltips were also added to the zip codes to show which neighborhood
          it corresponds to. Note that each zip code maps to multiple
          neighborhoods. To remain consistent with what the Fire Department
          uses, the neighborhood mapping was drawn from the how the data was
          labeled in the dataset. If the zipcode was improperly labeled, the
          tooltip will also show the same inconsistencies. However, this seemed
          to be the most accurate way to represent the information.
        </p>

        <p>
          To encourage data exploration, brushing on the x axis for the area
          chart is supported. This will filter the stacked bar chart based on
          the time range of the brush. Click and drag in the area chart to
          create a range and click out of the range in the area chart to reset.
          You can adjust the brushed selection by moving it or by adjusting the
          size. Since it is a little difficult to see what date range you have
          selected, the date range is displayed (and is updated) above the
          stacked bar chart.
        </p>

        <p>A sample of using the visualization is shown here:</p>

        <h3 id="analysis">Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          From this visualization we can learn several things:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            It seems that 94129 and 94130 show up near the top in many date
            ranges. This makes sense since it is the Presidio and Treasure
            Island, respectively. This may mean that the Fire Department might
            need an additional station in either of those places.
          </li>
          <li>
            The time from response to arrival always seems to take the most
            time, so any attempt at alleviating traffic for the Fire Department
            would help immensely.
          </li>
          <li>
            We can also see dramatic spikes in the area chart which implies that
            there are outliers or events that took substantially longer than
            expected. Using brushing, we can confirm this is the case and narrow
            the date range of the incidences. For example, 94111 had a very high
            entry time in the time frame of December 24th 2016 to December 27th,
            2016.
          </li>
        </ul>
